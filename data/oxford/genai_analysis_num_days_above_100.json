"{\n    \"analysis\": \"The data shows a gradual increase in the number of days above 100 degrees Fahrenheit over the years, with some fluctuations. There are noticeable spikes in certain years, indicating possible extreme heat events. Overall, there is a rising trend in the data, suggesting a warming climate.\",\n    \"risks\": \"The increasing number of days above 100 degrees Fahrenheit poses several risks, including heat-related illnesses, strain on energy resources for cooling, damage to infrastructure, and impacts on agriculture and natural ecosystems. These risks can disproportionately affect vulnerable populations and regions.\",\n    \"suggestions\": [\n        \"Implement heat-resilient building designs and urban planning strategies to reduce heat exposure in properties.\",\n        \"Encourage the use of energy-efficient cooling systems and renewable energy sources to mitigate the strain on energy resources during hot days.\",\n        \"Promote green spaces and tree planting to provide shade and reduce the urban heat island effect.\",\n        \"Educate property owners on heat safety measures, such as staying hydrated, avoiding outdoor activities during peak heat hours, and checking on vulnerable individuals.\",\n        \"Collaborate with local authorities and community organizations to develop heat emergency response plans and communication strategies to protect residents during extreme heat events.\"\n    ]\n}"
