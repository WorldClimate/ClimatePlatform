"{\n  \"analysis\": \"The data shows a consistent and alarming trend of 360 days per year above 80 degrees Fahrenheit starting from the year 2024 and continuing through 2080. This indicates a significant increase in the number of days with extreme heat, which can have detrimental effects on various aspects of the environment and human health.\",\n  \"risks\": \"The increase in the number of days above 80 degrees Fahrenheit poses several risks such as heat-related illnesses, reduced crop yields, increased energy consumption for cooling, strain on water resources, and exacerbation of air quality issues. These risks can have far-reaching impacts on public health, agriculture, infrastructure, and ecosystems.\",\n  \"suggestions\": [\n    \"Implement heat wave early warning systems to alert residents of dangerous heat conditions\",\n    \"Promote the use of cool roofs and green spaces to reduce urban heat island effect\",\n    \"Encourage energy-efficient practices to reduce the overall demand for electricity during peak heat periods\",\n    \"Invest in sustainable water management strategies to ensure availability of water during heatwaves\",\n    \"Develop emergency response plans to address the health impacts of extreme heat events\"\n  ]\n}"
