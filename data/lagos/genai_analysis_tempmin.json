"{\n    \"analysis\": \"The data shows a gradual increase in projected minimum temperature over the years, indicating a warming trend. The rate of change in temperature is not constant, but overall shows an upward trajectory.\",\n    \"risks\": \"The increasing minimum temperature can lead to a number of climate risks such as heatwaves, droughts, and changes in ecosystems. This can impact agriculture, human health, water resources, and biodiversity.\",\n    \"suggestions\": [\n        \"Implement energy-efficient practices to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate further climate change\",\n        \"Invest in green infrastructure to reduce the urban heat island effect\",\n        \"Promote sustainable agriculture practices that are resilient to changing climate conditions\",\n        \"Educate communities on heat safety measures to reduce health risks during heatwaves\",\n        \"Develop and implement policies for water conservation and efficient water use to combat droughts\"\n    ]\n}"
