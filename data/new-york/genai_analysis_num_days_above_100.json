"{\n    \"analysis\": \"The data shows a clear increasing trend in the number of days above 100 degrees Fahrenheit over the years, starting from almost no days in 2024 to a peak of 44.37 days in 2076. This indicates a significant rise in extreme heat events over time.\",\n    \"risks\": \"The increasing number of days above 100 degrees Fahrenheit poses several risks such as heat-related illnesses, strain on energy resources for cooling, agricultural challenges, and infrastructure damage. It can also exacerbate existing inequalities as vulnerable populations are more susceptible to the impacts of extreme heat.\",\n    \"suggestions\": [\n        \"Encourage the use of energy-efficient cooling systems to minimize energy consumption during peak heat days.\",\n        \"Implement urban heat island mitigation strategies such as increasing green spaces and reflective surfaces to lower overall temperatures.\",\n        \"Promote heat wave emergency preparedness and response plans to protect vulnerable populations.\",\n        \"Educate property owners on heat-related illnesses and symptoms, as well as proper hydration and cooling strategies.\",\n        \"Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure to withstand the increasing heat stress and reduce risks of damage.\"\n    ]\n}"
