"{\n    \"analysis\": \"The data shows a significant increase in the number of days above 100 degrees Fahrenheit starting from the year 2071. This trend continues with spikes in 2078 and 2079, indicating a potential acceleration in the rate of change. If this trend continues, it poses a serious risk to human health, agriculture, and ecosystem stability.\",\n    \"risks\": \"The increasing number of days above 100 degrees Fahrenheit poses risks such as heat-related illnesses, reduced crop yields, water scarcity due to increased evaporation, and stress on ecosystems leading to biodiversity loss.\",\n    \"suggestions\": [\n        \"Implement heat-resilient building designs to mitigate indoor heat exposure.\",\n        \"Promote tree planting and green roofs to provide shade and cooler microclimates in urban areas.\",\n        \"Invest in sustainable water management practices to prevent water scarcity during hot days.\",\n        \"Encourage the use of reflective materials for pavements to reduce the urban heat island effect.\",\n        \"Educate the public on heat safety measures such as staying hydrated and avoiding outdoor activities during peak heat hours.\"\n    ]\n}"
