"{\n    \"analysis\": \"The data shows a trend of increasing minimum temperatures over the years, with some fluctuations. This indicates a warming trend in the future.\",\n    \"risks\": \"The increasing minimum temperatures pose several climate risks such as more frequent and intense heatwaves, changing agricultural patterns, increased demand for cooling solutions leading to higher energy consumption, and potential impact on biodiversity.\",\n    \"suggestions\": [\n        \"Implement energy-efficient cooling solutions in buildings and homes to reduce energy consumption and lower carbon emissions.\",\n        \"Promote sustainable farming practices that can adapt to changing temperature patterns and optimize water usage.\",\n        \"Invest in green infrastructure such as urban green spaces and green roofs to mitigate heat island effects in cities.\",\n        \"Develop early warning systems and heat action plans to protect vulnerable populations during heatwaves.\",\n        \"Encourage reforestation and planting of native tree species to enhance natural resilience to temperature changes and support biodiversity.\"\n    ]\n}"
