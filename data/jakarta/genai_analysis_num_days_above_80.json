"{\n    \"analysis\": \"The data shows that for the years 2024-2043, the Number of days above 80 degrees Fahrenheit remains constant at 360 days. However, from 2041 onwards, there is a slight decrease in the number of days above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, with the data dropping to 359.33 days in 2041 and increasing again to 360 days by 2043. This suggests a potential trend towards slightly cooler temperatures in the later years.\",\n    \"risks\": \"One risk associated with this projection is that property owners may underestimate the impact of even a small decrease in the number of days above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This could lead to inadequate preparation for changing climate conditions, potentially resulting in increased energy costs, damage to property, and compromised comfort levels.\",\n    \"suggestions\": [\n        \"Educate property owners about the potential impact of even small changes in climate conditions on their properties\",\n        \"Encourage property owners to invest in energy-efficient cooling systems to mitigate the effects of warmer temperatures\",\n        \"Promote the use of green infrastructure, such as green roofs and shade trees, to help reduce urban heat island effects\",\n        \"Provide resources for property owners to conduct climate resilience assessments and develop adaptation plans\",\n        \"Collaborate with local government and community organizations to implement neighborhood-wide climate resilience initiatives\"\n    ]\n}"
